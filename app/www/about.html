<h2>About this App</h2>
<p>
 Introduction to the t-distribution. This app first illustrates how the degrees of freedom are related to the shape of a t-distribution and how it compares to the normal distribution. The second exploration illustrates why the t-distribution is a better choice than the normal distribution for small samples when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample standard deviation is used as an estimate of the population standard deviation.
