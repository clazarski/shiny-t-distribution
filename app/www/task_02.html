<h3> Z-test vs t-test</h3>
<p>
     The graph above shows the results of 1000 random sample means of a size set by the slider being drawn from a normal distribution with mean 10 and standard deviation of 50. A z-test and a t-test are both performed on each sample using the sample standard deviation to calculate the standard error. The following hypotheses are tested: <br>

     H<sub>0</sub>: &mu; = 10 <br>
      H<sub>a</sub>: &mu; > 10

</p>

<p>
  For a specified alpha the number of rejected test statistics is calculated from among the 1000 samples. You can compare the proposed type 1 error rate to the actual type 1 error rates for various sample sizes and standard deviations. (Note: Any rejected test statistics are errors since the truth is that the mean is 10)
